\chapterinitial{Basal melting} of ice shelves in marine ice sheets (the Antarctic Ice Sheet?) is a control for the stability of the ice sheet and global sea level rise projections. It has been identified as a significant driver of uncertainty in sea-level rise (SLR) projections.A part of this uncertainty derives from unpredictable internal variability in ocean and atmosphere temperatures around ice shelves. This uncertainty can be quantified using large ensembles of ice sheet model simulations, with each ensemble member influenced by an alternate realization of such external climate variable evolution (climate "forcing"). However, running such a large number of climate and ice sheet simulations is computationally prohibitive. Here, we develop and demonstrate a statistical technique that generates random realisations of basal melt rate projections which emulate a single long simulation from the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) in a computationally efficient manner. Internal climate variability plays an important role in influencing  basal melt of ice shelves, which in turn can affect the stability of the ice sheet and global sea level rise.
