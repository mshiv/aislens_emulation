In this study, we use a statistical approach to generate realistic ocean forcing with spatiotemporal variability for ice sheet models. This generation technique ensures spatially and temporally consistent variability, while also facilitating the sampling of a wide range of melt trajectories. We first use a high resolution earth system model to simulate the ocean driven meltwater flux around the southern ocean, i.e., the ocean forcing. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) decomposition is used to emulate spatial variability fields, given that EOFs retain spatial correlation properties across the domain.The projection coefficients from the EOF analysis are then phase randomised to emulate temporal variability fields and generate reconstructed ensemble realisations of the basal melt trajectories.Each such ensemble member can be characterised as an independent realisation of the ice sheet model simulation output with variable thermal forcing.
